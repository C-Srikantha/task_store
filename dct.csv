A qualified technician should reset the OBD-II fault codes and then road test the vehicle to see if the code or Check Engine Light come back on. He can observe this by watching data on a scanner with live readings and verifying there is 5 volts input to the IAT sensor. If the IAT Sensor input voltages to the ECU are not correct, then it is most likely the IAT sensor is bad and needs replacement.

P0010,"P0010 is a generic OBD-II code indicating an issue with the engine control module (ECM) detecting a variation in the mechanical timing between the crankshaft and bank 1 camshaft. The timing issue is typically detected during higher RPMs of the engine when the ECM attempts to adjust valve lift during higher speeds.The ECM uses sensors to detect the position of the crankshaft and camshaft(s). From these sensor signals, the ECM controls ignition, valve lift, and fuel timing under various speeds and loads. The code will illuminate the Check Engine Light and possibly reduce engine performance.","The Engine Positions System Performance Bank 2 code may have several causes: Engine timing out of sync Engine oil sludge (from lack of oil changes) Worn timing components (chains, gears, guides) Crankshaft or camshaft sensor malfunctions Wiring damage ECM software out of date ECM internal damage",The P0010 code will produce a Check Engine Light on the instrument panel / dashboard. It will likely: Affect engine idle quality Reduce fuel economy Affect engine performance at higher RPMs Fail an emissions inspection,"P0010 is properly diagnosed with an advanced scan tool capable of factory sensor readings and codes (not just one from your local auto parts store) to start. A qualified technician can read the data from the scan tool to determine when and where the problem occurred or if it is still occurring. They may clear the code from the ECM and test drive the vehicle while monitoring the scan tool data to see if the fault returns or if it is intermittent.Engine sludge with the oil system is very common for this fault code. It is common to remove the solenoid which the code indicates to inspect the screen filter for sludge and manually activate it with a test probe.If the fault is intermittent, then a visual inspection of the solenoid or the wiring may produce more results. Otherwise, the vehicle will have to be driven until the problem becomes more persistent.If the fault returns immediately, the scan tool and information from professional resources should be able to narrow down the problem. Otherwise, a digital voltage scope used to monitor the sensor signals will be required. The signals will indicate what the ECM is seeing and if they are correct.Based upon the results of the testing, possible clearing of the code(s), and a road test while monitoring the data, further diagnosis may be required.

P0977,"The P0977 code is a standard OBD trouble code that detects an issue with the shift solenoid valve B control circuit. Shift solenoids are used to help create smooth gear shifts in the automatic transmission. The various shift solenoids control the brakes, bands, and clutches in the transmission, with the B solenoid varying depending on the make and model of the vehicle. The transmission control module (TCM) controls the shift solenoids, and activates and deactivates them as necessary to adjust the gear ratios and facilitate smooth shifting. If the TCM records an abnormal voltage reading from the shift solenoid B control circuit, then that circuit will be disabled, and the powertrain control module (PCM) will note the P0977 code.","A few factors can cause the P0977 code to be detected: Faulty shift solenoid valve B Malfunctioning control circuit Damaged or defective electrical components, such as wires, connectors, and fuses Low transmission fluid levels Dirty or contaminated transmission fluid In rare cases, a faulty PCM, TCM, or engine control module (ECM)","The P0977 trouble code is usually accompanied by the check engine soon Warning Light illuminating on the instrument panel. The vehicle will commonly experience transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, delayed or rough acceleration, and the inability to access certain gears. It is likely that the vehicle will also experience reduced fuel efficiency.","The P0977 code will be addressed with the aid of a standard OBD-II trouble code scanner. A trained mechanic will use the scanner to look at the freeze frame data and assess the code. Additional trouble codes should also be checked for, and if found, they should be addressed in the order in which the scanner displays them. The trouble codes will then need to be reset, and the vehicle restarted, so the technician can see if the code remains detected. If it does not, then an erroneous trigger or an intermittent error are the most probable culprits.If the P0977 code returns, then the mechanic will check the transmission fluid. If the fluid is at an insufficient level, then it should be replenished, and the mechanic should thoroughly search for signs of leakage. If the fluid is dirty, it can be flushed out and replaced, but if it is contaminated then there is probably extreme damage to the transmission. This will likely require a replacement, or a full rebuild. Next, the mechanic should visually inspect the electrical components, and replace any wires, connectors, or fuses that are damaged or compromised.If the issue is not yet found, then a digital volt/ohmmeter can be utilized to help identify the circuit that corresponds to the valve B shift solenoid. After the correct circuit is ascertained, the solenoid, harness, and circuit should all be inspected.Whenever the technician replaces or repairs a component, the trouble codes should be reset, and the vehicle restarted, so the code can once again be checked for. This helps the technician figure out when the problem is resolved.","A vehicle with the P0977 trouble code will still be drivable, though it may experience severe enough transmission problems that it is not practical to drive. If the P0977 code is not addressed, it can cause further damage to the transmission, so it’s important to have the vehicle inspected as soon as the code is noticed.","Repairs for the P0977 trouble code are: Shift solenoid valve B replacement Replacement of the electrical components Replacement or addition of transmission fluid In very rare cases, replacement of the PCM, ECM, or TCM"
